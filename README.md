# Web Scraping Challenge
In the present project we utilize various scrapping tools (Python splinter, BeautifulSoup, pandas, etc.) to retreive information on Mars from 4 different web sites. We present the data in a Python Flask app by pulling it from a MongoDB collection. The information is displayed in an HTML webpage which contains a link to a route ("Update Data!") which re-executes the scraping function, updates the MongoDB collection and re-plots the data based on new updates.
